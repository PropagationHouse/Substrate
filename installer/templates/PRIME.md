# Startup Script

Tasks to run when the agent starts up. Uncomment (remove `<!-- -->`) any tasks you want active.

## On Startup

Feel free to say hello however you wish.

## Notes

- Tasks run once on each cold start, in order, in a background thread
- The agent uses tools if enabled, otherwise responds via chat
- Add new tasks as `- task description` lines under **On Startup**
- Comment out tasks with `<!-- -->` to disable them
